DOWNLOAD:
- Download EdiLogger.Common
- Download EdiLogger.Main
SETUP:
- Copy both directories into a single directory

BUILDING:
The actual module that runs on the robot.
The module needs to be cross-compiled for the robot, so use the NAO/Geode toolchain for this.
Replace ~/Progs/NAO/ctc-academics-1.6.0 with the path to your own NAO/Geode toolchain file

To build the module:
cd EdiLogger/module
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/Progs/NAO/ctc-academics-1.6.0/toolchain-geode.cmake ..
make

Use "ccmake ." in the build directory to switch the bulid type from RELEASE to DEBUG for better
debugging.

RUNNING:
- Copy produced library to NAO. 
- Copy Configurattion files to "/home/nao/data/Logger_Config.txt"

CONFIGURATION:
- Configuration files are shipped with the package.
- Logger_Config.txt is an ini file. Every entry in the file looks like following:
  Tag=ALName
  Tag stands for the name which message will use to deliver the message.
  Name stands for the name of the variable in ALMemory which logger will copy.
- Logger_Config.txt should contain an entry "Name" containing the name a name for the agent.
