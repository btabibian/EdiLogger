DOWNLOAD:
- Download EdiLogger.Common
- Download EdiLogger.Communication
SETUP:
- Copy both directories into a single directory

BUILDING:
The actual module runs on the robot.
The module needs to be cross-compiled for the robot, so use the NAO/Geode toolchain for this.
Replace ~/Progs/NAO/ctc-academics-1.6.0 with the path to your own NAO/Geode toolchain file

To build the module:
cd EdiLogger/communication
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/Progs/NAO/ctc-academics-1.6.0/toolchain-geode.cmake ..
make

Use "ccmake ." in the build directory to switch the bulid type from RELEASE to DEBUG for better
debugging.

RUNNING:
- Copy produced library to NAO. 
- Copy Configurattion files to "/home/nao/data/Comm_Config.txt"

CONFIGURATION:
- Configuration files are shipped with the package.
- Comm_Config.txt is an ini file. Every entry in the file looks like following:
  Port=PortNumber 
  IP=IPNumber
  Port number indicates which port module should listen to
  IP number indicates which IP/HostName should module connect to.
- Port number for Main Module is 1100.
